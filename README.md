Restricted Boltzman Machines in Akka

Implementing Restricted Boltzman machines in Akka.

Probably not the most effecient method as matrix based methods probably offer the most speed.
I was more interested in creating complex akktor systems and replicating the mechanics or actual neural functioning.
